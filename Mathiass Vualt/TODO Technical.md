- [x] Make grapplingphysics more consistent
- [x] temp GH returning mode
	- [x] Though make the rotatian lerp
- [x] Though make the rotatian lerp
- [x] Simple GH animations

Scriptableobjects
- Make all variables use it?
- Make only the infocenter use it?

Sliding
- [x] temperairy sliding
- [ ] make sliding more refined
- [ ] Better animation

- [x] Make an alt version for the turning animation, utylizing position rather than rotation
- [x] Bug: Sometimes the grapplinghook decresses speed to a hold when uncoupling (beacouse collider to GH)
